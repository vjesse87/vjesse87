👋 Hello World! I'm Jesse Van Brakel, a senior at Arizona State University pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Economics. 🎓 My passion for understanding the dynamics of economies and markets drives me to explore the world of data analysis and economic modeling.

🖥️ Alongside my studies in Economics, I've also dabbled in the fascinating world of programming. I've taken several Java courses with a specific focus on object-oriented programming 🚀, which has allowed me to develop my skills in creating efficient, scalable, and maintainable software solutions. 

💡 I believe that the synergy between Economics and programming offers unique insights and solutions to real-world challenges. On my GitHub, you'll find projects that showcase my journey in both fields, including data analysis projects, economic simulations, and Java-based applications.

🌱 As I continue to learn and grow, I'm always eager to collaborate and contribute to exciting projects that align with my interests. Feel free to reach out for any collaborations or discussions on Economics, programming, or anything in between!

Let's connect and create something impactful together! 🤝😊
