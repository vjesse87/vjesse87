👋 Hello World! I'm Jesse Van Brakel, a senior at Arizona State University pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Economics. 🎓 My passion for understanding the dynamics of economies and markets drives me to explore the world of data analysis and economic modeling.

🖥️ Alongside my studies in Economics, I've also dabbled in the fascinating world of programming. I've taken a Java course with a specific focus on object-oriented programming 🚀.

💡 I believe that the synergy between Economics and programming offers unique insights and solutions to real-world challenges.

🌱 As I continue to learn and grow, I'm always eager to collaborate and contribute to exciting projects that align with my interests. Feel free to reach out for any collaborations or discussions on Economics, programming, or anything in between!
